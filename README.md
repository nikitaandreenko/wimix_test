# Wimix test task

## ***In this task I used***

* `Spring framework`  
* `Spring REST`
* `Spring Boot`
* `Spring Data`
* `Hibernate ORM`
* `Spring Security + JWT`
* `PostgreSQL`

1. User registration and creating (**after registration**, it becomes possible to get a **token**)
2. Updating profile (**after authorization**)
3. Getting one user (**after authorization**)
4. Getting a list of users (**with pagination**) by ***id*** (direction **asc**)


Unfortunately, I could not implement adding to the ~~websocket~~ and everything connected with it, since more knowledge of the frontend is needed
